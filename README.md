# Description 

Welcome to my fourth Friday Project! I hope you enjoy your stay :)


Check out my page and repos here:

https://github.com/zwabbe


# Setup/Installation 

This website is very straight forward to use! But demonstrates the use of inputs, prototypes and objects in the form of a Pizza menu. 

## How to use:
* Select your desired Pizza size and the topping options presented. 
* Once selected press Submit to show results of your order with total. 



## If you wish to make changes to the project then follow these steps: 

* Clone the repo from this link: https://github.com/zwabbe/pizza.git

 * Open the desired files with your favorite text editor.  I suggest downloading VScode! Once open plug away and edit the content to your pleasure! :)

# Specifications

```
Describe: Pizza()

Test: Pizza variable "size" to change depending if Small , Med, or Large radio button selected.
    Expect: Selecting small changes Var Size.toEqual("small").
        Results: Working!!

Test: Click all 4 toppings and run a loop that creates a Var called toppings with array of selected toppings.
    Expect: Var toppings to equal [topping1, topping2,topping3,topping4]
        Results: Working!!

Test: Create new Pizza object with properties from size and toppings while also adding a base price for the Pizza.
    Expect:  newPizza() to become object Pizza with properties {size=s,m,l, toppings=[t1,t2,t3,t4], base cost: 10}
        Results: WORKING!

Test: Take customer order and run it through calculateOrder prototype. Takes base cost for Pizza and then adds  the cost of the chosen size + value amount of each topping to give us our total cost. 
    Expect: baseCost.Equals(10) + SmallPizza.val(1) + x4Toppings.val(1each) = total (15)
        Result: Works!

Test: Output to show customers selected size, toppings and total cost for their order under the menu.
    Expect: (OrderResults).toDisplay "You have order 'pizza size'  with t1,t2,t3,t4!  Total: (total cost). "
        Results: Works!
