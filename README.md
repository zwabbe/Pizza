# Description 

Welcome to my fourth Friday Project! I hope you enjoy your stay :)


Check out my page and repos here:

https://github.com/zwabbe


# Setup/Installation 

This website is very straight forward to use! But demonstrates the use of inputs, prototypes and objects in the form of a Pizza menu. 

## How to use:
* Select your desired Pizza size and the topping options presented. 
* Once selected press Submit to show results of your order with total. 



## If you wish to make changes to the project then follow these steps: 

* Clone the repo from this link: https://github.com/zwabbe/pizza.git

 * Open the desired files with your favorite text editor.  I suggest downloading VScode! Once open plug away and edit the content to your pleasure! :)
