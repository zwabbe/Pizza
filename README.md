        Results: Working!!

    Expect: Var toppings to equal [topping1, topping2,topping3,topping4]

        Results: Working!!

Test: Create new Pizza object with properties from size and toppings while also adding a base price for the Pizza.

    Expect:  newPizza() to become object Pizza with properties {size=s,m,l, toppings=[t1,t2,t3,t4], base cost: 10}

        Results: WORKING!


Test: Take customer order and run it through calculateOrder prototype. Takes base cost for Pizza and then adds  the cost of the chosen size + value amount of each topping to give us our total cost. 

    Expect: baseCost.Equals(10) + SmallPizza.val(1) + x4Toppings.val(1each) = total (15)

        Result: Works!

Test: Output to show customers selected size, toppings and total cost for their order under the menu.
